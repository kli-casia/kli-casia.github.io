<br>Hello there! I'm Kai Li, currently an Associate Professor with <a href="http://www.crise.ia.ac.cn/">Center for Research on Intelligent System and Engineering (CRISE)</a> at <a href="http://english.ia.cas.cn/">the Institute of Automation, Chinese Academic of Sciences (CASIA)</a>, Beijing, China. I received the Ph.D. degree from <a href="http://www.nlpr.ia.ac.cn/en">National Laboratory of Pattern Recognition (NLPR)</a>, CASIA in 2018. My supervisor is <a href="http://people.ucas.ac.cn/~0001572">Prof. Weiming Hu</a> and <a href="http://people.ucas.ac.cn/~0051452?language=en">Pro. Junliang Xing</a>. Before that, I received the B. Eng. degree from <a href="http://en.dlut.edu.cn/">Dalian University of Technology (DUT)</a>, Dalian, China, in 2013.<br><br>
			
My research interests include <b>Deep Learning</b> and <b>Reinforcement Learning</b>. My current work focuses on exploration in deep reinforcement learning, multi-agent deep reinforcemnt learning, opponent modelling, and imperfect information game solving. In my opinion AGI cannnot be achieved without an interdisciplinary approach. My long term goal is to add some pieces to the puzzle :-) <b>Please do not hesitate to drop me an email if you are interested in working with me</b>.
	
I am a third-year PhD student at <a href="https://www.cs.jhu.edu/">Johns Hopkins University</a>, working in the <a href="https://www.clsp.jhu.edu/">Center for Language and Speech Processing (CLSP)</a>, advised by <a href="https://clsp.wse.jhu.edu/faculty-pages/sanjeev/">Sanjeev Khudanpur</a> and <a href="http://www.danielpovey.com/">Dan Povey</a>. My research interests lie in the application of machine learning methods for speech and language tasks. I am currently working on <b>speech recognition</b> and <b>speaker diarization</b> in real, far-field, overlapping speech scenarios.<br><br>

I graduated from IIT Guwahati in 2017 with a major in Computer Science. My bachelor thesis was on deep learning methods for relation extraction in clinical text, supervised by <a href="http://www.iitg.ac.in/anand.ashish/index.html">Ashish Anand</a>.<br><br>

When I’m not doing ML, I like to work out, climb boulders, play guitar, and <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/62772844-desh-raj?shelf=read&sort=date_read">read fiction</a>.<br>
