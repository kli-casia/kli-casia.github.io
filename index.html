<br>Hello there! I'm Kai Li, currently an Associate Professor with <a href="http://www.crise.ia.ac.cn/">Center for Research on Intelligent System and Engineering (CRISE)</a> at the <a href="http://english.ia.cas.cn/">Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy of Sciences (CASIA)</a>, Beijing, China. I received the Ph.D. degree from <a href="http://www.nlpr.ia.ac.cn/en">National Laboratory of Pattern Recognition (NLPR)</a>, CASIA in 2018, under the supervision of <a href="http://people.ucas.ac.cn/~0001572">Prof. Weiming Hu</a> and <a href="http://people.ucas.ac.cn/~0051452?language=en">Prof. Junliang Xing</a>. Before that, I received the B. Eng. degree from <a href="http://en.dlut.edu.cn/">Dalian University of Technology (DUT)</a>, Dalian, China, in 2013.<br><br>
			
My research interests include <a href="https://www.deeplearningbook.org/">Deep Learning</a> and <a href="http://incompleteideas.net/book/the-book.html">Reinforcement Learning</a>. My current work focuses on exploration in deep reinforcement learning, multi-agent deep reinforcement learning, opponent modelling, and imperfect information game solving. In my opinion AGI cannot be achieved without an interdisciplinary approach. My long-term goal is to add some pieces to the puzzle :-) <b>Please do not hesitate to drop me an email if you are interested in working with me</b>.
