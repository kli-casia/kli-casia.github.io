<br>Hello there! I'm Kai Li, currently an Associate Professor with <a href="http://www.crise.ia.ac.cn/">Center for Research on Intelligent System and Engineering (CRISE)</a> at the <a href="http://english.ia.cas.cn/">Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy of Sciences (CASIA)</a>, Beijing, China. I received the Ph.D. degree from <a href="http://www.nlpr.ia.ac.cn/en">National Laboratory of Pattern Recognition (NLPR)</a>, CASIA in 2018. My supervisor is <a href="http://people.ucas.ac.cn/~0001572">Prof. Weiming Hu</a> and <a href="http://people.ucas.ac.cn/~0051452?language=en">Pro. Junliang Xing</a>. Before that, I received the B. Eng. degree from <a href="http://en.dlut.edu.cn/">Dalian University of Technology (DUT)</a>, Dalian, China, in 2013.<br><br>
			
My research interests include <a href="https://www.deeplearningbook.org/">Deep Learning</a> and <a href="http://incompleteideas.net/book/the-book.html">Reinforcement Learning</a>. My current work focuses on exploration in deep reinforcement learning, multi-agent deep reinforcement learning, opponent modelling, and imperfect information game solving. In my opinion AGI cannot be achieved without an interdisciplinary approach. My long term goal is to add some pieces to the puzzle :-) <b>Please do not hesitate to drop me an email if you are interested in working with me</b>.
